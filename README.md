This is my coursework project, web-interface for [LiquidSoap](http://savonet.sourceforge.net/) (source client for internet radio server, expected to be used with [Icecast2](http://www.icecast.org/)) written in Ruby on Rails.

Example of LiquidSoap config can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/ilyakhokhryakov/6114659).
